# Finding-Lost-Shipments
During the holiday, we are meeting huge volume of order, meanwhile, we lose shipment lists all the time. We would create a query that gives us a shipment ID if we put in as many shipment IDs as we have in the tote, and the query gives us the shipment ID. For example, I have a tote with 3 items in it but no packing slip. Normally, we can only look up 1 SKU in SKU info and have to click through each shipment ID to find the one that has the same items as are in the tote.Ideally, we have a query that we can put all 3 SKUs in a query and it just gives us the shipment IDs that have all of those SKUs in it. It will help our warehouse team members check the lost packages in a short time.Â
